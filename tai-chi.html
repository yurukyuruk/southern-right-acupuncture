                <h1>Tai Qi and Qi Gong Classes</h1>
                <p class="tai-chi-first-part">
                    Tai Qi is an internal martial art that claims significant health
                    benefits. For example: studies have shown how it reduces the risk of
                    falls among the elderly. As with meditation, the mind is calm, the
                    cardiovascular circulation harmonises, joints lose their stiffness,
                    bones are strengthened and muscles become pliable.

                        The movements are graceful and deliberate at the same time. Specific
                        attention is placed on intention and posture. Breathing is regulated
                        and mental clarity and calmness ensue.

                    <p>
                        There is a special beauty in seeing Tai Qi being performed by a group
                        or individuals in the park. He has trained students who continue
                        practicing, and remember him as they do their slow graceful movements
                        in the morning or evening.
