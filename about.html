                        Dr Gideon is a specialist in <strong>Acupuncture</strong>, <strong>Tai Qi</strong>, 
                        <strong>Qi Gong</strong> and <strong>Tuina</strong>(Traditional Chinese Medical Massage).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        He treats clients on a case-by-case basis, using ancient medicine as a
                        modern choice – drawing from his vast knowledge and applying a range
                        of different modalities and techniques. He has 20 years of experience
                        in delivering individual private sessions, has traveled extensively
                        and helped clients in 4 continents.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Dr Gideon starts all treatments with an initial consultation, during
                        which time a full medical and family history is taken and a discussion
                        is had with the client regarding their outcome expectations and their
                        primary complaints. Via a range of diagnostic techniques, he
                        formulates a working diagnosis after which a treatment plan is
                        discussed with the client, tailored to their specific needs and
                        resources. Gideon instils confidence in his clients, supporting and
                        guiding them to uncover the deeper hidden reasons for their
                        discomfort. By resolving blockages on multiple levels, homeostasis is
                        achieved and the path to extraordinary health is explored.
                        Confidentiality is assured.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Gideon has worked with clients from all walks of life and various
                        nationalities / ethnicities, diagnosing and treating a vast array of
                        conditions. These treatments have resulted in lasting impacts, not
                        just on health and well-being on a physical level but also on a mental
                        and spiritual level. He actively avoids self-promotion or ‘guru-ship’,
                        always encouraging his students and clients to find their own path and
                        graduate from his presence.
