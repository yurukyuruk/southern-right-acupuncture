                        Traditional Chinese medicine is a comprehensive approach to holistic
                        health that has stood the test of time. Its classical text, The
                        Huangdi Neijing (given the English title <i>The Yellow Emperor's Classic of
                        Medicine</i>), is an ancient treatise on health and disease said to have
                        been written by the famous Chinese emperor Huangdi more than 2500
                        years ago. It is still very relevant today.

                        The aim of TCM is to reestablish homeostasis; to achieve this it has
                        developed a unique diagnostic method and a range of treatment options.
                        Acupuncture, Moxibustion, Cupping, Herbal prescription, Guasha are
                        some of these.

                        Acupuncture involves the insertion of very thin, sterilized needles
                        into specific acupuncture points on the body in order to rebalance
                        your qi (or life force), guiding the body towards natural healing, and
                        restoring balance and health to the mind, body, and spirit.
                        Acupuncture is a holistic approach to healing that involves treating
                        the whole person by finding the root cause of a condition in a gentle, 
                        compassionate way.

                    During the initial consultation, the patient's comprehensive medical history and
                    current medical condition will be evaluated to result in a diagnosis.
                    A treatment plan and strategy will then be discussed and planned. The
                    initial consultation includes a treatment and generally takes about an hour.
